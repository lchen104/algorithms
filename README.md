# Introduction
Learning basic Algorithms and understanding their time complexity

## Algorithms
- Fibonacci (Find fibonacci number on index of n)
- Primality (Returns true if n is a prime number)
- isEven (Returns true if n is an even number)
- isPowerOfTwo (Determine whether an input number is a power of two)
- isSmallest (Find the smallest number in an array)
- sumArray (Return the sum of an array)
- sumIntergers (Return the sum of n from var start to var end)
- sumUp (Return the sum of n nunber of elements)
- Factorial (Return the sum of n number of elements multiplied by one another)
- Palindrome (Return true if word inputed is a palindrome (spelled the same forwars/backwards))
